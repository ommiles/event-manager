# Rails has a built in mechanism to protect against cross site request forgery (CSRF) attacks. 
# By default this sees Rails generate a unique token and validate its authenticity with each POST PUT PATCH DELETE request. 
# If the token is missing, Rails will throw an exception.
# However, as we are building a single-page app, we will only have a fresh token upon first render, which means we will need to alter this behaviour. 
# The code below ensures that if no CSRF token is provided, Rails will respond with an empty session, which is fine for our purposes.

    # The above code ensures that if no CSRF token is provided,
